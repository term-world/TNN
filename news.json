	"text": "<p>Given the recent influx of individuals into term-world, traffic has been impossibly inundated, incensing impatient idlers who are, in a word, irate. The irritating impact of this impotent infrastructure was immediately identified by our incredible Mayor when he involved himself with an important inspection of the near-infinite incidence of intolerable wait times. He said in an insightful insider interview implicating inept engineers: \"I'm incredulous! It's irresponsible, immoral, insidious!\"</p><p>It was during this deep-dive that he delved into his daring directive to delete the downright dismal deadlock that has defiantly drawn speed demons and doddering Sunday drivers alike to a dead standstill. We've deliberately dedicated the space down below to the disclosure of his dynamic declaration:</p><p>\"It's me, your Mayor! You, pen jockey, you're getting all this down, right? That was my catchphrase. It's very important. Please try and keep up. For me. Your Mayor. Anyway, where was I?\"</p><p>\"Ahem, in my capacity as your Mayor I've spent a tireless hour mulling over how we might fix this teeny-weeny little...er, what's a word that says, 'I see we have a problem here, but I'd rather not call it a problem'? Oh yeah, that's good...I, your Mayor, was mulling over how we might fix this teeny-weeny little traffic hiccup. And I, your Mayor, have come up with a brilliant solution!\"</p><p>\"You, my fair citizens, did such a wonderful job of enacting my incredible neighborhood economy proposal that I, your Mayor, figured that if you could handle that, then you could surely handle this! Hey, glasses, are you sure you're getting all this? It's important to butter the people up, you know. That's like, Mayor 101.\"</p><p>\"Actually, I think that's everything. Let's see, we have a hiccup, you can fix it, yada yada...yeah, that should do. You got my catchphrase, right? Gotta have a soundbite for the people. Okay, good. Now scram.\"</p>"
