  "text": "<p>For months now, the neighborhoods in the suburbs of term-world have been ghost towns. The once-bustling streets of communities like Andra and Folivoria have been host to little more than the occasional tumbleweed ever since local property owner The Landlord raised rent rates to untenable levels in an attempt to only bring the best and brightest (and wealthiest) to our fair term-world.</p><p>In our exclusive interview with The Landlord, it was revealed that his able assistant The Intern argued that even properties with rock-bottom rent rates bring in more bacon than abandoned abodes. So, in a move that could only be called \"inspired,\" \"obvious,\" or maybe even \"capitalistically altruistic,\" The Landlord is slashing rates to less than a tenth of what they once were. That's right, you'll no longer need a six-figure income to call one of these fine houses with three-figure square footage yours.</p><p>Word must've gotten out; nearly fifty new tenants have applied to live in the six neighborhoods owned and maintained by The Landlord. Only time will tell what these wide-eyed tenants will bring to term-world...</p>"
