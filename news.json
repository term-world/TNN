	"text": "<p>Dear citizens of term-world, it is I, your Mayor. Having heard your deepest wants and needs, having listened to you for so long, understanding -- even if in a somewhat distanced way (you are merely the people after all) -- what it is that you most desire, the time has come to let you use some of your power (however meagre) to effect the changes you wish to see in our fair city. That is right, my citizens, I have heard you, and you want to work.</p><p>And work you must! As one of my trusted mentors in all things political once said, \"nothing good ever comes.\"</p><p>So there's nothing to look forward to except the glow, the sheen, the aura of the work that you will complete for that very same nothing.</p><p>However, I allow that perhaps some things in term-world don't work exactly the way that you want them to. For example, our power system, while splendid for me, may not perform the same for you. Our world's inventory might not seem to function \"correctly,\" as one with a critical eye might say. I've heard discussions of a, \"mass transit\" system, which is something my advisors tell me that I wouldn't like because the word \"mass\" means more than just <em>me</em>.</p><p>So begin your planning! Decipher the many systems that the world offers you! Propose whatever it is that you've been telling me that you want (and you'll need to propose it because, frankly, I've forgotten everything anyone has suggested to me). Let's get to work people! We have a new status quo to build, uphold, and leverage for <em>my gain!</em></p>"
